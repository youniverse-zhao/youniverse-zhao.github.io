I started working on the Machine Learning Specialisation on Coursera. To me, Prof. Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s Machine Learning course on Coursera is one of the go-to material to get started with Machine Learning. This is my second time learning this course on Coursera, and the first time I did it, it was not yet a specialisation.</description></item><item><title>üìö | Show Your Work</title><link>https://youniverse.site/posts/2023/01/show-your-work/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 22:39:35 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://youniverse.site/posts/2023/01/show-your-work/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Build sharing into my routine.&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>Coursera | Machine Learning Specialisation (2/n) - Supervised Learning</title><link>https://youniverse.site/posts/2023/01/coursera-machine-learning-specialisation-2/n-supervised-learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 15:11:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://youniverse.site/posts/2023/01/coursera-machine-learning-specialisation-2/n-supervised-learning/</guid><description>Supervised Learning ‚ÑπÔ∏è Supervised machine learning, or supervised learning, refers to algorithms that learn the input to output, or $x$ to $y$, mapping.
The key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from, i.e., the training set, which include the right answers, i.e., the correct label $y$ for a given input $x$. With the correct pairs of input $x$ and desired output label $y$, the learning algorithm learns to take just the input alone without the output label and gives a reasonably accurate prediction of the output.</description></item><item><title>Coursera | Machine Learning Specialisation (1/n) - Overview</title><link>https://youniverse.site/posts/2022/12/coursera-machine-learning-specialisation-1/n-overview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 14:10:34 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://youniverse.site/posts/2022/12/coursera-machine-learning-specialisation-1/n-overview/</guid><description>The current version is a specialisation consisting three courses:
Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification; Advanced Learning Algorithms; Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning. This article is a brief summary of Machine Learning taken from the specialisation.
The first course in the specialisation, &amp;ldquo;Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification&amp;rdquo;, provides a brief summary of the machine learning domain and goes introduces the details of supervised machine learning.
Machine Learning ‚ÑπÔ∏è Machine learning (ML) is the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.</description></item><item><title>YAK8s 101: 1 | What is K8s?

When setting up a Golang working environment, broadly speaking, there are two ways: using a package manager/installer or installing from source. Most of the time it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to use a package manager or installer and by executing one or two commands, the entire working environment is ready to use. Well, this time, I just would like to see how manual installation works.
Head Let me first list all the steps that I can think of for the installation:</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://youniverse.site/posts/2021/04/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 2021 01:52:58 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://youniverse.site/posts/2021/04/hello-world/</guid><description>üòä</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://youniverse.site/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://youniverse.site/about/</guid><description>Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift.
