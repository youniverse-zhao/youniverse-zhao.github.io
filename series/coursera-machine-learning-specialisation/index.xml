I started working on the Machine Learning Specialisation on Coursera. To me, Prof. Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s Machine Learning course on Coursera is one of the go-to material to get started with Machine Learning. This is my second time learning this course on Coursera, and the first time I did it, it was not yet a specialisation.</description></item><item><title>Coursera | Machine Learning Specialisation (2/n) - Supervised Learning</title><link>https://youniverse.site/posts/2023/01/coursera-machine-learning-specialisation-2/n-supervised-learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 15:11:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://youniverse.site/posts/2023/01/coursera-machine-learning-specialisation-2/n-supervised-learning/</guid><description>Supervised Learning Definitions and Notations Lowercase $x$: the standard notation to denote input, or input variable, or feature; Lowercase $y$: the standard notation to denote output, or target variable; Training set: the dataset that is used to train a model, i.e., all training examples; $m$: the total number of training examples; $(x, y)$: a single training example; $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$: a specific training example, corresponds to a specific row in a table.</description></item><item><title>Coursera | Machine Learning Specialisation (1/n)</title><link>https://youniverse.site/posts/2022/12/coursera-machine-learning-specialisation-1/n/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 14:10:34 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://youniverse.site/posts/2022/12/coursera-machine-learning-specialisation-1/n/</guid><description>The current version is a specialisation consisting three courses:
Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification; Advanced Learning Algorithms; Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning. This article is a brief summary of Machine Learning taken from the specialisation.
The first course in the specialisation, &amp;ldquo;Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification&amp;rdquo;, provides a brief summary of the machine learning domain and goes introduces the details of supervised machine learning.
Machine Learning ℹ️ Machine learning (ML) is the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.</description></item></channel></rss>
